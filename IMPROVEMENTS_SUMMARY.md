        if (selectedCount > 0) {
            $('#deleteSelectedBtn').show();
        } else {
            $('#deleteSelectedBtn').hide();
        }
    }
    
    // Delete selected students

        const count = selected.length;
        if (!confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete ${count} student(s)? This cannot be undone!`)) {
            return;
        }
        
        $.ajax({
            url: '/admin/students/delete-multiple',
            method: 'POST',
            contentType: 'application/json',
