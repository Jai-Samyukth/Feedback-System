### 4. Archive and Reset System

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL OPERATION - READ CAREFULLY

#### Purpose
Archive existing feedback data and reset the system for a new feedback cycle (new semester/academic year).

#### When to Use Archive Function

‚úÖ **Use Archive When**:
- End of semester
- Before starting new feedback cycle
- Academic year completion
- System needs to be reset for new batch

‚ùå **DO NOT Use Archive If**:
- Feedback collection is still ongoing
- You haven't backed up all required reports
- You're not authorized to reset the system
- Any uncertainty exists

#### What Archive Does

**‚úÖ Data Preserved (Backed Up)**:
- Complete database backup in `history/` folder
- Timestamped archive folder
- All tables and data intact in backup

**‚úÖ Tables Cleared (Reset)**:
- Ratings table (all feedback entries)
- Submitted feedback tracking
- Admin mappings (staff-subject assignments)
- Students list

**‚úÖ Tables Preserved (NOT Cleared)**:
- Staff/Faculty list
- Subjects list
- Departments list
- Semesters list

**‚úÖ Files Deleted**:
- Generated PDF reports
- Temporary log files
- Submission tracking files

#### Step-by-Step Archive Process

**Step 1: Preparation (DO THIS FIRST!)**

Before clicking archive:

1. ‚úÖ **Generate and download ALL feedback reports**
   - For all departments
   - For all semesters
   - Save to safe location

2. ‚úÖ **Generate and download non-submission reports**
   - Document participation rates
   - Save for records

3. ‚úÖ **Notify all stakeholders**
   - Inform admin/IT team
   - Notify other HODs
   - Ensure everyone has completed their reports

4. ‚úÖ **Get management approval**
   - Confirm you have authority
   - Document the archival decision

5. ‚úÖ **Choose appropriate timing**
   - Do NOT archive during feedback collection
   - Wait until after all reports are reviewed
   - Typically done during semester break

**Step 2: Execute Archive**

1. Login to HOD portal
2. Select any department and semester (doesn't matter which)
3. Locate **"Archive and Reset System"** button
   - Usually at bottom of page
   - May be red or prominently marked
4. Read the warning message carefully
5. Click **"Archive and Reset System"** button
6. Confirm the action if prompted
7. Wait for completion message (may take 30-60 seconds)

**Step 3: Verify Archive**

1. Check `history/` folder for new timestamped backup
   - Example: `history/15-Jan-2025--14-30-00/`
2. Verify backup contains `feedback_backup.db`
3. Confirm success message appears
4. Test that system is reset (try viewing a report - should show no data)

**Step 4: Post-Archive Setup**

After archiving, you need to:

1. **Add new students** for upcoming semester
   - Contact admin to upload new student list
2. **Create new mappings**
   - Admin assigns staff to subjects for new semester
3. **Notify students** 
   - Inform them system is ready for new feedback
4. **Update credentials** (if needed)
   - Change passwords for new semester

#### Archive Folder Structure

Archive creates a timestamped folder:

```
history/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 15-Jan-2025--14-30-00/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feedback_backup.db    (Complete database backup)
```

**Timestamp Format**: `DD-Mon-YYYY--HH-MM-SS`

**Example**: `15-Jan-2025--14-30-00` means:
- Date: January 15, 2025
- Time: 14:30:00 (2:30 PM)

#### Recovering Archived Data

If you need to recover archived data:

1. **Locate Archive Folder**:
   - Go to `history/` directory
   - Find the relevant timestamped folder

2. **Contact IT Support**:
   - Provide timestamp of needed archive
   - Request data restoration
   - IT will restore from `feedback_backup.db`

3. **Alternative - Manual Recovery**:
   - Copy `feedback_backup.db` from archive
   - Replace current `data/feedback.db`
   - Restart application

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Manual recovery requires technical knowledge. Contact IT support.

#### Common Archive Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **DON'T**:
1. Archive before downloading all reports
2. Archive while feedback collection is active
3. Archive without management approval
4. Archive without notifying other users
5. Delete history folders (permanent data loss!)
6. Archive multiple times in quick succession

‚úÖ **DO**:
1. Download all reports first
2. Wait until feedback cycle is complete
3. Get proper authorization
4. Notify all stakeholders
5. Maintain multiple backups
6. Document archive dates and reasons

---

## üìà Data Analysis and Interpretation

### Analyzing Individual Faculty Performance

#### Step 1: Review Overall Average

**High Performer (8.5+)**:
- ‚úÖ Recognize and reward
- ‚úÖ Ask to mentor junior faculty
- ‚úÖ Share best practices in department meetings
- ‚úÖ Nominate for teaching awards

**Good Performer (7.0-8.4)**:
- ‚úÖ Acknowledge good work
- ‚úÖ Encourage continued excellence
- ‚úÖ Identify specific strengths to enhance
- ‚úÖ Provide resources for further improvement

**Average Performer (5.5-6.9)**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Schedule one-on-one meeting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Discuss feedback results openly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Create improvement plan together
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Offer mentorship or training
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Follow up regularly

**Low Performer (Below 5.5)**:
- ‚ùå Immediate meeting required
- ‚ùå Formal improvement plan
- ‚ùå Assign senior faculty mentor
- ‚ùå Mandatory training programs
- ‚ùå Regular monitoring and support
- ‚ùå Consider classroom observation

#### Step 2: Analyze Individual Parameters

Look for patterns in the 10 parameters:

**Consistently High Across All Parameters**:
- Strong overall teaching
- No major weaknesses

**Mixed Ratings**:
- Identify specific weak areas
- Target improvement efforts
- Example: Low on "Pace" ‚ûú Speed adjustment needed

**Consistently Low Across All Parameters**:
- Systemic issues
- May need fundamental retraining
- Consider reassignment or additional support

#### Step 3: Identify Strengths and Weaknesses

**Questions to Ask**:
1. Which parameters are rated highest?
2. Which parameters are rated lowest?
3. Is there a pattern across multiple faculty?
4. Are weaknesses fixable through training?
5. Do strengths align with department goals?

**Example Analysis**:

Faculty: Dr. Smith
- High ratings (9+): Preparation, Subject Mastery, Clarifying Doubts
- Low ratings (5-6): Pace, Use of Examples

**Action**: 
- Maintain strengths
- Focus improvement on pacing and practical examples
- Share teaching resources
- Encourage peer observation

### Comparative Analysis

#### Compare Within Department

**Across Faculty**:
- Who are top performers?
- Who needs support?
- What's the department average?
- Are there consistent problem areas?

**Action Items**:
- Pair low performers with high performers
- Department-wide training for common weaknesses
- Share teaching strategies in meetings

#### Compare Across Semesters

Track individual faculty over time:

**Improving Trend** (5.0 ‚ûú 6.5 ‚ûú 7.5):
- ‚úÖ Acknowledge improvement
- ‚úÖ Recognize effort
- ‚úÖ Continue support

**Declining Trend** (8.0 ‚ûú 7.0 ‚ûú 6.0):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Investigate causes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Is it workload? Personal issues?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Offer support and resources

**Stagnant** (6.0 ‚ûú 6.0 ‚ûú 6.0):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Intervention needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Current methods not working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Try new approaches

#### Compare Across Subjects

**Subject-Specific Patterns**:
- Are theoretical subjects rated lower than practical?
- Do lab courses get better ratings?
- Are core subjects rated differently than electives?

**Insights**:
- May indicate curriculum issues, not teacher issues
- Some subjects inherently more challenging
- Consider subject-specific teaching strategies

### Department-Wide Insights

#### Identifying Trends

**Common High Ratings**:
- Department doing well in these areas
- Leverage as strengths
- Share with other departments

**Common Low Ratings**:
- Department-wide issue
- Needs collective action
- Training or resource allocation

**Example**:
If multiple faculty rate low on "Use of Examples":
- Organize workshop on practical teaching
- Share industry examples
- Invite guest speakers
- Develop case study library
